Anki add-on that allows you to export media files from a chosen deck to a folder.

The add-on can be accessed from a menu item named "Export Media" under the gears icon besides each deck's name in the main screen.

By default, the add-on only exports audio files. You can change that from the add-on's configuration under *Tools > Add-ons*.
