Anki add-on that allows you to export media files from a chosen deck or note to a folder.

The add-on can be accessed from a menu item named "Export Media" under the gears icon besides each deck's name in the main screen. There is also an editor button to export media from the current note.

By default, the add-on exports all media files. You can instead make it export only audio files from the add-on's configuration under *Tools > Add-ons*.
